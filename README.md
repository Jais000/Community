Welcome to Community!
A hub, for communities large and small. 
Upcoming features. 
Service Catalog. For any occasion or event, an admin will be able to manage every facet of an event or organization. For instance, if I sought to organize a wedding, I could simply click Host wedding, and I would be presented
with every need, and a catalog of available servicers, photographers, stores, graphic designers, wedding locations, etc. 
If I wanted to host a party, I would be presented with locations, Dj's, security services, etc. 
Optimal disclosure(such as, front page positioning for a server) would cost money. 
Money comes from ads. 
We will take a portion from the cost to change domains. 
Last but not least, autopay. 
An admin may host an event which requires purchasable tickets. Thus, he or she will set up an event, and tick on the ticket price. All members will have credit information logged in, and at the tap of a button, 
pay or not. We will take a cut here as well. 
Group outings!
Three, four, five or fifty friends might want to go to a bar. An admin selects one of many locations. Of entertainment section, such will select bar, and of bar, such will select locations by 
occasion, costs, city, etc. The bar will be notified, and they will immediately begin developing the drinks. As the group arrives by Uber or once roaming autopiloted vehicles, they can be immmediately served.
We will take a small cut of the tab.
